# Brah Programming Language

Brah is intended to be a modern version of an old conceptual language called
portugol (i.e. structure portuguese), still used in some Brazillian universities
to introduce Algorithms and Logic. Also, it is intended to be an intepreted
programming language featuring most of, if not all, OOP concepts. This project
should be undestood as an prototype or an MVP.
